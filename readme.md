QuakeNX is based on QuakeX and build using the NXDK for XBOX.


Please note that some things are still work in progress:
- loading savegames is broken due to certain functionality not being ready in pdclib
- cd audio (I've written some basic code to load CD audio I just haven't gotten around to integrating it)

More info soon
